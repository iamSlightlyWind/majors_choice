# Major's Choice

Major's Choice is a SWP391 project that lists computer components as a website selling them

## Trigger GitHub Action

[![Run Workflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Run%20Workflow-blue)](https://majors-choice.vercel.app/api/trigger)

Everyone can test the website at https://choice.themajorones.dev by pressing the "Run Workflow" button.

Note that the server takes up to 5 minutes to start, and will not run again unless the previous run has expired (1 hour).

## Project Overview

The rough idea is to sell the latest generations of PC parts, including the most basic components used to build a PC: CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, PSU, and case. The website will list the most common and popular PC hardware from the last 3 generations. Optional features of the website will be a build your PC which checks for parts compatibility and a comparison feature that compares the 2 hardware from the same category for performance and price-to-performance ratio.

## Proof of concept

While the backend of things seems simple enough, having the server run on the open web is an order of magnitude more knowledge than what I currently have right now. What I have in mind is to have GitHub runner run the server, preferably having it runs a docker image that I created, so it doesn't have to start over whenever I boot it up. or even better, have it run on GitHub codespace, if I understand correctly, is the same as GitHub Runner, but I will have GUI access to a port forwarding terminal. This will have to be successfully tested working, as well as deployed to the server before starting the project.

## Hardware Validation

This feature ensures the compatibility of the selected components. Here are the checks performed:
