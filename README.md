# Major's Choice
Major's Choice is a SWP391 project that lists computer components as a website selling them

## Project Overview

The rough idea is to sell the latest generations of PC parts which include the most basic components used to build a PC, namely CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, PSU, and case. The website will list the most common and popular from the last 3 generations of PC hardware. Optional features of the website will be a build your own PC which checks for parts compatibility and a comparison feature that compares the 2 hardware from the same category for performance and price to performance ratio.

## Proof of concept

While the backend of things seems simple enough, having the server runs on the open web is an order of magnitude more knowledge than what I currently have right now. What I have in mind is to have github runner run the server, preferably having it run a docker image that I created, so it doesn't have to start over whenever I boot it up. or even better, have it run on github codespace, if I understand correctly, is the same as github runner, but I will have GUI access to a port forwarding terminal. This will have to be successfully tested working before starting the project.
