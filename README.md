# Major's Choice
Major's Choice is a SWP391 project that lists computer components as a website selling them

## Project Overview

The rough idea is to sell the latest generations of PC parts which include the most basic components used to build a PC, namely CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, PSU, and case. The website will list the most common and popular from the last 3 generations of PC hardware. Optional features of the website will be a build your own PC which checks for parts compatibility and a comparison feature that compares the 2 hardware from the same category for performance and price to performance ratio.
